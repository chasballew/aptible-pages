questions_title: Questions? We have answers.
questions:
    - inquiry: What’s the difference between Platform and Managed accounts?
      response: |
        A Platform account is designed for companies who have HIPAA compliance in-house or are handling PHI only for testing and development. The entire technology infrastructure needed to handle PHI is encompassed in a Platform account. A Managed account, on the other hand, includes a platform account plus full-service compliance. The workforce training, documentation, reporting, and audit support for HIPAA compliance--pricing is variable based on the unique needs of your app and team. 
    - inquiry: What is the 1 TB Disk space used for? 
      response: |
        The 1 TB of disk is shared across all of the containers and is used by both databases and file storage. 
    - inquiry: What’s a 1 GB container?  Can I get more?
      response: |
        The 1GB refers to the RAM per container.  Both the platform and managed accounts include six containers.  Typically customers use different containers for applications, databases, etc.  With the Docker deployment model, you can scale any application across multiple containers very easily.  At the Managed tier, we customize the specifications of your containers but most customers don’t need this.
    - inquiry: How much load can I handle per container?
      response: |
        This depends on the language and web framework of your specific application. Typically, there is a direct correlation between RAM and concurrency. Having more RAM means that you can have more workers running concurrently. For instance, one container holds 1 GB RAM and a share of an AWS m3.medium (Intel Xeon E5-2670 v2).

        We are happy to work with you to customize your container. Platform and Managed stacks are isolated per-customer, so you enjoy full resources of the instance dedicated to your apps. 


    - inquiry: When using one of the PHI-ready environments, should I have my Dev, Staging and Pro tiers all hosted in a PHI-ready environment or in a Dev environment?
      response: |
        Using a Dev environment has the benefit of server isolation between staging and production. So if an instance crashes, your other environments are unaffected. If that's not an issue, the PHI-ready environments are dedicated to just you, so performance can be better - especially during long builds. We have customers doing both, so it's really your preference.
